# Portfolio

Welcome, Everyone!👋 This is the codebase of [my portfolio website](https://o-louis.com/).

I decided to do it once again to have a fresh new look.

The previous one was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) but this one with [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/).

I hope you'll like it ! 🙂
